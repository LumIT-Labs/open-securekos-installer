Open Secure-K OS HD Deployer (alias Installer)
==============================================

**Open Secure-K OS** (https://github.com/LumIT-Labs/open-securekos) is a **liveng**-compliant (https://liveng.readthedocs.io) operating system built using Linux Debian components. 

**Open Secure-K OS HD Deployer** is the deployment system for writing the Open Secure-K OS initial ISO image onto a hard drive - it will create the **liveng partitioning scheme**. It's an Open Secure-K OS Deployer fork, adapted for being able to write the image onto hard drives (only).

Open Secure-K OS and Open Secure-K OS Deployer are **LumIT Labs** projects.

See the forked project for the documentation, https://github.com/LumIT-Labs/open-securekos-deployer.
This program must be launched from a live operating system and of course not from the hard drive it'll be write to.
